# Introduction to the Labs

These are simple lab exercises
to help you learn how to develop secure software.
They were designed to support the
“Developing Secure Software” (LFD121) and
"Secure Software Development Fundamentals" (edX) program.

These labs will run on your local web browser,
so you don't need to install anything
and you don't need to log into a remote system.

You'll be writing snippets of code in a web page.

In these labs you'll write code in JavaScript.
However, if you're not familiar with JavaScript, don't worry;
we'll help you along by providing starter code.
Our focus is on the fundamentals of developing secure software
(not JavaScript specifically).
If you want to learn more about JavaScript, there are many resources available,
such as [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net).

In many cases you'll be writing code that uses Express,
a widely-used server-side framework for JavaScript, along with
`express-validator`, a widely-used validation framework for Express.
However, we'll often fill in other parts, so you can focus on the
specific issues we're discussing.

Many labs compare your attempt against a pattern for an expected
correct answer. In many cases you can find an obscure way to write
code that would produce the correct result yet not counted as a correct
answer. For example, instead of writing `1` you could write `(2-1)` or
`0x1`. We are looking for code that is *simple* and *clear*, not just
code that would produce the correct answer.
