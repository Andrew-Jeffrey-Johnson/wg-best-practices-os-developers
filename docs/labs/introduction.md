# Introduction to the Labs

These are simple lab exercises
to help you learn how to develop secure software.
They were designed to support the
“Developing Secure Software” (LFD121) and
"Secure Software Development Fundamentals" (edX) program.

These labs will run on your local web browser,
so you don't need to install anything
and you don't need to log into a remote system.

You'll be writing code in a web page, and then press "Check" to check it.
We'll then try out many inputs to see if the code you wrote behaves
correctly.

In these labs you'll write code in JavaScript.
However, if you're not familiar with JavaScript, don't worry;
we'll help you along by providing starter code.
Our focus is on the fundamentals of developing secure software
(not JavaScript specifically).
If you want to learn more about JavaScript, there are many resources available,
such as [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net).

In most cases you'll be writing for a simulated version of Express,
a widely-used server-side framework for JavaScript.
This isn't the full version of Express, it's simply a simulation to
make the exercises easy.

We *do* use a version of `validator`, retrieved from
